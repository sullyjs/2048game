#This file contains the code for a spin on the game 2048. The numbers are based off the Fibonacci numbers, and there's a 3D board, meaning both a 2x2
#and 4x4 board that can be moved using the asdw and arrow keys. This code is further connected to a specially designed GUI.
#This was written in Spyder Anaconda.
